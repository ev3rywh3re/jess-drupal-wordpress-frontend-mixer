# Jess's WordPress Drupal Frontend Mixer

A basic web development environment for using Wordpress and Drupal websites with a frontend library like Vue or NextJS.

Goal is to use DDEV to create a local network of sites that will be used for development. In this case it will be a WordPress, Drupal, and blank frontend site. In my use case I am using Orbstack for my Docker/virtualization and Composer for my package and installation management.

The current setup is like so

* frontend
* wordpress
* drupal
