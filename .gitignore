# Ignore everything within the individual site directories.
# This prevents the actual site code, dependencies (vendor, node_modules),
# configuration (.env), build artifacts (dist), and their specific .ddev
# configurations from being committed to THIS repository.
# Each sub-project could potentially be its own Git repository later.
